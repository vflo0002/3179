                <p align="center" style="text-align: justify;">Utilising our interactive choropleth map, examine the spatial distribution of crime throughout the Australian states between 2014 and 2023. One may quickly compare the visual intensity of crime by region using this visualisation, which shows the number of crimes per 10,000 people. A range of 100 to over 2000 crimes per 10,000 persons indicates that the deeper the blue, the higher the crime rate. To view the evolution of crime rates over the course of a decade, use the slider beneath the map to select a particular year. With the ability to identify places where crime rates have changed significantly over time and to understand regional security trends, this tool is a valuable resource.

                <p align="center" style="text-align: justify;">With the aid of our extensive heat map, investigate the precise age-based distribution of crime victims throughout the different Australian states. The impact of crime on different demographic groups is illustrated by the number of victims within a given age range for each state, represented by a cell. A brief visual representation of the most afflicted age groups and geographic areas is given by the colour intensity, which ranges from light (fewer victims) to dark (more casualties). In order to effectively manage and reduce crime, public safety organisations and legislators can use this visualisation, which highlights important patterns such the increased proportion of young and middle-aged persons affected in particular states.

                    unique happiness landscape. But what's the Dystopia Residual, you ask? It's a whimsical measure that helps us understand how far each region's 
                    happiness level deviates from the hypothetical 'dystopia,' adding an intriguing layer to the story of global well-being.

                This whimsical metric measures how far a region's happiness level stands from a make-believe state of ultimate unhappiness, known as 'dystopia.' It's like 
                gauging the gap between a place's real joy and the absolute pits of despair. The bigger the gap, the happier the region is, making it a unique and playful 
                way to understand regional happiness. So, when you see a high Dystopia Residual, it means that region is a long way from the land of gloom, and happiness reigns 
                supreme!
